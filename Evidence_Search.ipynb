            "Answer: Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug. After its discovery in 1975, its first uses were in veterinary medicine to prevent and treat heartworm and acariasis. Approved for human use in 1987, it is used to treat infestations including head lice, scabies, river blindness, strongyloidiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis and lymphatic filariasis. It works through many mechanisms to kill the targeted parasites, and can be taken by mouth, or applied to the skin for external infestations. It belongs to the avermectin family of medications. William Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura won the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and applications. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an antiparasitic agent. In 2021, it was the 341st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 100,000 prescriptions. It is available as a generic medicine., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin\n",

            "Answer: Durga Puja, also known as Durgotsava or Sharodotsav, is an annual festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga, and is also celebrated because of Durga's victory over Mahishasura. It is particularly celebrated in the Eastern Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Odisha and by Hindus in Bangladesh. The festival is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin, which corresponds to September–October in the Gregorian calendar. Durga Puja is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of the most significance. The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations. The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts, revelry, gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions called a melā. Durga Puja is an important festival in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja\n",

            "Answer: Robert Hunter Biden is an American attorney and businessman. He is the second son of U.S. President Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden. Biden was a founding board member of BHR Partners, a Chinese investment company, in 2013, and later served on the board of Burisma Holdings, one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine, from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019. He has worked as a lobbyist and legal representative for lobbying firms, a hedge fund principal, and a venture capital and private equity fund investor. Since early 2019, Hunter and his father have been the targets of false allegations of corrupt activities concerning Ukraine, which intensified after the New York Post published an article in October 2020 about a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden. Biden was convicted of three federal firearms-related felony charges in June 2024 after he had admitted to \"illegally owning a gun while a drug user\"., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden\n",

            "Answer: In October 2020, a controversy arose involving data from a laptop that belonged to Hunter Biden. The owner of a Delaware computer shop, John Paul Mac Isaac, said that the laptop had been left by a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden. Mac Isaac also stated that he is legally blind and could not be sure whether the man was actually Hunter Biden. Three weeks before the 2020 United States presidential election, the New York Post published a front-page story that presented emails from the laptop, alleging they showed corruption by Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee and Hunter Biden's father. According to the Post, the story was based on information provided to Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney of incumbent president and candidate Donald Trump, by Isaac. Forensic analysis later authenticated some of the emails from the laptop, including one of the two emails used by the Post in their initial reporting., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy\n",

He has worked as a lobbyist and legal representative for lobbying firms, a hedge fund principal, and a venture capital and private equity fund investor. Since early 2019, Hunter and his father have been the targets of false allegations of corrupt activities concerning Ukraine, which intensified after the New York Post published an article in October 2020 about a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden. Biden was convicted of three federal firearms-related felony charges in June 2024 after he had admitted to \"illegally owning a gun while a drug user\"., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden\n",

            "Answer: The Bharatiya Janata Party is one of the two major political parties in India, along with the Indian National Congress. As of 2019, it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the national parliament and state assemblies and is the world's largest party in terms of primary membership. BJP is a right-wing party, and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions. It has close ideological and organisational links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The BJP's origin lies in the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by Syama Prasad Mukherjee. After the State of Emergency in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the Janata Party; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the 1977 general election., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party_(BJP)\n",

            "Question: Who is Ulysses S. Grant?\n",
            "Answer: Ulysses S. Grant was an American military officer and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877. As commanding general, Grant led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War in 1865 and briefly served as U.S. secretary of war. An effective civil rights executive, Grant signed a bill to create the United States Department of Justice and worked with Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction. Grant was born in Ohio and graduated from West Point in 1843. He served with distinction in the Mexican–American War, but resigned from the army in 1854 and returned to civilian life impoverished. In 1861, shortly after the Civil War began, Grant joined the Union Army and rose to prominence after securing Union victories in the western theater. In 1863, he led the Vicksburg campaign that gave Union forces control of the Mississippi River and dealt a major strategic blow to the Confederacy., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant\n",

            "Answer: The World Health Organization is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has six regional offices and 150 field offices worldwide. The WHO was established on April 7, 1948, and formally began its work on September 1, 1948. It incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the League of Nations' Health Organization and the Paris-based Office International d'Hygiène Publique, including the International Classification of Diseases. The agency's work began in earnest in 1951 after a significant infusion of financial and technical resources. The WHO's official mandate is to promote health and safety while helping the vulnerable worldwide. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets international health standards, collects data on global health issues, and serves as a forum for scientific or policy discussions related to health., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization\n",

It is the most-watched cable news network in the U.S., and as of 2023 generates approximately 70% of its parent company's pre-tax profit. The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan. Fox News provides a service to 86 countries and territories, with international broadcasts featuring Fox Extra segments during advertising breaks.

It launched on October 7, 1996, to 17 million cable subscribers., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News\n",

            "Answer: On August 23, 2020, Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old black man, was shot and seriously injured by police officer Rusten Sheskey in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Sheskey shot Blake in the back four times and the side three times after Blake opened the driver's door of an SUV belonging to the mother of his children, and attempted to reach inside. Sheskey said that he believed he was about to be stabbed, since Blake was holding a knife. Earlier during the encounter, Blake had been tasered by two officers, but the tasers failed to disable him and he continued toward the vehicle. Blake had a warrant for his arrest from July, based on charges of third-degree felony sexual assault and trespassing and disorderly conduct for domestic abuse in May. Both Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis and the Kenosha Professional Police Association stated that the officers dispatched on August 23 were aware of the pending warrant for Blake before they arrived on scene; dispatch records confirm this., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Jacob_Blake\n",

            "Answer: Kyle Howard Rittenhouse is an American man who gained national attention at age 17 for shooting three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin—two fatally—in August 2020, amid protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha during the unrest, and joined a group of armed people who said they were there to protect businesses. In a series of confrontations, Rittenhouse fatally shot two men who had tried to grab his gun, and injured another who had pointed a firearm at him. Rittenhouse was subsequently charged by Kenosha County prosecutors with multiple criminal counts, including homicide. Rittenhouse claimed self-defense at trial and was acquitted in November 2021. Two civil lawsuits against him are pending as of February 2023. Rittenhouse's prosecution attracted widespread media coverage, becoming a cause célèbre for American right-wing organizations and media., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Rittenhouse\n",

            "Answer: Kyle Howard Rittenhouse is an American man who gained national attention at age 17 for shooting three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin—two fatally—in August 2020, amid protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse had traveled to Kenosha during the unrest, and joined a group of armed people who said they were there to protect businesses. In a series of confrontations, Rittenhouse fatally shot two men who had tried to grab his gun, and injured another who had pointed a firearm at him. Rittenhouse was subsequently charged by Kenosha County prosecutors with multiple criminal counts, including homicide. Rittenhouse claimed self-defense at trial and was acquitted in November 2021. Two civil lawsuits against him are pending as of February 2023. Rittenhouse's prosecution attracted widespread media coverage, becoming a cause célèbre for American right-wing organizations and media., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Rittenhouse\n",

            "Answer: Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is an American politician who is serving as the 46th president of the United States since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate from 1973 to 2009. Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He graduated from the University of Delaware in 1965 before earning his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and the U.S. Senate in 1972, as one of the youngest Senators in history. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 and 2008 Democratic presidential nominations., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden\n",

            "Answer: Nancy Patricia Pelosi is an American politician who served as the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress, leading the House Democrats from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents California's 11th congressional district, which includes most of San Francisco. She is the dean of California's congressional delegation. Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, and is the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington, in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children., URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi\n",

            "Question: Has the U.S. of America been using its media outlets to publish articles based on fabricated information under alleged violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention?, Best response: Russia is likely having difficulty targeting the Ukrainian military logistics network and is resorting to easier static targets, including civilian facilities.Russia has also resorted to using older, less-accurate missiles as its strike campaign has significantly depleted its stockpile of more modern munitions while failing to achieve a decisive strategic effect.Now facing unprecedented sanctions, Russian industry and supply chains will have significant difficulty replenishing stocks of advanced munitions and the other large-scale losses of Russian military equipment.Russia’s false claim:Russia claims that it is successfully targeting shipments of Western-supplied military equipment being provided to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.2022-06-09National DefencePosted on: 2022-06-09 - National DefenceThe facts:Ukraine is actively contesting control of these areas, and it has conducted counterattacks, which have prompted some Russian withdrawals.Russia continues to impose heavy-handed measures on local Ukrainians, including media control, arbitrary arrests, and forced economic integration with Russia, including the seizure of agricultural produce for re-sale.Russia’s invasion has exposed Ukraine’s civilian population to an elevated risk from mines and other unexploded ordinance that will take years to clear.Russia’s false claim:Russia claims that it is establishing a permanent presence in the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, and that life in these areas is returning to normal.2022-06-02National DefencePosted on: 2022-06-02 - National DefenceThe facts:Russia has repeatedly attacked civilian infrastructure in and around Odesa with long-range missiles.Elements of the Russian Black Sea Fleet have repeatedly sailed threateningly towards Odesa, forcing Ukraine to maintain defences along the shore and in coastal waters.Russia has occupied and stationed military assets on Ukraine’s Snake (Zmiinyi) Island south of Odesa, raising the collateral threat to merchant shipping in the area.Russia has linked the issue of allowing the safe transit of grain from Odesa to sanctions relief for Russia, showing that it treats its blockade of critical food supplies as a bargaining chip.Russia’s false claim:Russia claims that it is not blocking export of grain from the Ukrainian port of Odesa, and that a “humanitarian corridor” is available to allow much-needed food supplies to reach global markets.2022-05-27National DefencePosted on: 2022-05-27 - National DefenceThe facts:Russia routinely trains and deploys mercenary forces, and it has again done so in its invasion of Ukraine.Russian mercenaries are currently attacking Ukrainian forces defending towns in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.Leaders and fighters for private Russian military companies typically include right-wing extremists and convicted criminals.Russian mercenaries have a track record of indiscriminate violence and looting in locations around the world, which will only compound the suffering Ukraine has already endured.Russia’s false claim:Russian law outlaws mercenary forces and a new draft law is set to increase the prison terms for Russians found guilty of mercenary activity.2022-05-19National DefencePosted on: 2022-05-19 - National DefenceThe facts:Russian troops continue to occupy Kherson and the surrounding region, and have indiscriminately shelled urban areas throughout the invasion.The people of Kherson have strongly and publicly rejected Russia’s occupation, and they clearly do not support the illegitimate local authorities installed by Moscow.Fierce local opposition has forced Russia to cancel plans to hold a quick referendum on separation from Ukraine.Significantly, Russia has resorted to a “Russianization” campaign in Kherson, which includes internet censorship, forced use of Russian currency, and ongoing military occupation to try to suppress dissent.Russia’s false claim:Russia claims that it has no troops in the city of Kherson, and that Ukrainian forces have attacked the civilian population in retaliation for supporting Russia’s occupation.2022-05-12National DefencePosted on: 2022-05-12 - National DefenceThe facts:Russia’s war has damaged this season’s crop and is preventing Ukrainian grain from reaching global distribution chains and, therefore, foreign markets.We’ve see evidence that Russian forces have been seizing grain stocks and destroying grain storage facilities in occupied areas.Russia’s invasion has had profound impacts on global food security, constricting Ukraine’s domestic access to grain and leading to a spike in prices internationally, resulting in food insecurity across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.Russia’s false claim:Russian officials claim that Ukraine’s western allies want to forcibly export Ukraine’s grain supply to recoup their investments in the country.2022-05-04National DefencePosted on: 2022-05-04 - National DefenceThe facts:Russia’s air force has failed to establish air supremacy over Ukraine.Ukrainian forces continue to effectively engage Russian aircraft along the frontline with ground-based air defence systems.The contested airspace environment has forced Russia to rely on a dwindling stock of expensive long-range missiles to attack Ukrainian targets rather than further risk its air assets.Russia’s false claim:Russia routinely claims its air assets have successfully targeted dozens of Ukrainian command posts, fighting positions, and supply depots near the frontlines in the battle for the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.2022-04-28National DefencePosted on: 2022-04-28 - National DefenceThe facts:All of these regions continue to see major fighting as a result of Russia’s invasion.“Peaceful life” has not returned to occupied territory, as Russian forces continue to destroy infrastructure, loot, and suppress dissent in many occupied agricultural areas, in addition to suburban and urban zones.Russia’s invasion has forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes in agricultural communities, causing a major disruption to this year’s planting season\n",

            "Question: What is the Chemical Weapons Convention?, Best response: The Chemical Weapons Convention, officially the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction, is an arms control treaty administered by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, an intergovernmental organization based in The Hague, The Netherlands. The treaty entered into force on 29 April 1997. It prohibits the use of chemical weapons, and also prohibits large-scale development, production, stockpiling, or transfer of chemical weapons or their precursors, except for very limited purposes. The main obligation of member states under the convention is to effect this prohibition, as well as the destruction of all current chemical weapons. All destruction activities must take place under OPCW verification. As of August 2022, 193 states have become parties to the CWC and accept its obligations.\n",
