The Population of Nigeria (1950 - 2023) chart plots the total population count as of July 1 of each year, from 1950 to 2023. The Yearly Population Growth Rate chart plots the annual percentage changes in population registered on July 1 of each year, from 1951 to 2023. This value can differ from the Yearly % Change shown in the historical table, which shows the last year equivalent percentage change assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period. Definitions Year: as of July 1 of the year indicated. Population: Overall total population (both sexes and all ages) in the country as of July 1 of the year indicated, as estimated by the United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. World Population Prospects: The 2024 Revision. For forecasted years, the U.N. medium-fertility variant is used. Read More Definitions... Yearly % Change: For 2023: percentage change in total population over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30 2023). For all other years: latest year annual percentage change equivalent assuming homogeneous change in the preceding five year period, calculated through reverse compounding. Yearly Change: For 2023: absolute change in total population (increase or decrease in number of people) over the last year (from July 1, 2022 to June 30 2023). For all other years: average annual numerical change over the preceding five year period. Migrants (net): The average annual number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over the preceding five year period (running from July 1 to June 30 of the initial and final years), or subsequent five year period (for 2016 data). A negative number means that there are more emigrants than immigrants. Median Age: age that divides the population into two numerically equal groups: half of the people are older than the median age indicated and half are younger. This parameter provides an indication of age distribution. Fertility Rate: (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR), it is expressed as children per woman. It is calculated as the average number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive period (15 to 49 years old) based on the current fertility rates of every age group in the country, and assuming she is not subject to mortality. Density (P/Km\\u00b2): (Population Density) Population per square Kilometer (Km\\u00b2). Urban Pop % : Urban population as a percentage of total population. Urban Population: Population living in areas classified as urban according to the criteria used by each country. Country's Share of World Pop: Total population in the country as a percentage of total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. World Population: Total World Population as of July 1 of the year indicated. Global Rank: Position held by Nigeria in the list of all countries worldwide ranked by population (from the highest population to the lowest population) as of July 1 of the year indicated.

Union Work Did the large image of the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris logo projected onto a Harley-Davidson location in Milwaukee indicate the motorcycle manufacturer's endorsement of the Democratic presidential nominee? No, that's not true: Harley-Davidson said it is \\\"apolitical\\\" and the image was projected without its consent. It was in fact set up by the United Steelworkers union. The claim appeared in a post (archived here) on Facebook on October 20, 2020 and showed an image of the light projection. The post said: If anyone wants to trade in there Harley-Davidson come see me I've got plenty of other cruisers!!!!!!! This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Tue Oct 20 22:09:32 2020 UTC) This is another version of the post shared on Facebook: Lead Stories contacted Harley-Davidson on October 20, 2020 and was directed by a member of its media relations team to the company's post on Twitter, in which it said, The image projected on the Museum was done without our consent. Harley-Davidson is apolitical. Hi, the image projected on the Museum was done without our consent. Harley-Davidson is apolitical. -- Harley-Davidson (@harleydavidson) October 22, 2020 Similarly, Lead Stories conducted a Google search and did not find any indication that Harley-Davidson has endorsed either presidential candidate. The bat-light style logo has been repeatedly used by the United Steelworkers, an industrial union with about 1.2 million members across North America. It has projected the Biden-Harris logo, along with the union's own logo, in other high-profile buildings, whose owners also have not endorsed the Democratic candidate, including the Trump Tower in Chicago. Jess Kamm Broomell, a spokeswoman for the United Steelworkers, told Lead Stories: This is a USW project not undertaken in coordination with any other organization. The union has been using the light as an exciting and Covid-friendly way to start conversations about the importance of the election at a time when face-to-face contact has necessarily been limited. The Chicago Tribune reported the union, which has endorsed Biden's candidacy, has also projected the light on Wrigley Field in Chicago, Lambeau Field in Wisconsin and Terminal Tower in Cleveland.

The Republican president brought thousands of people together in Green Bay, where he contended the Democratic nominee would endanger the economy. Biden, wearing a mask and speaking to a small socially distanced crowd, ripped into Trump in Milwaukee, saying he had neglected his obligation to shield the country from the coronavirus pandemic. \\\"Donald Trump waved the white flag, surrendered to the virus,\\\" Biden said in a Mitchell International Airport hangar. \\\"Unlike Donald Trump, we're not going to surrender to this virus.\\\"Trump, at Green Bay Austin Straubel International Airport, countered: \\\"Biden will deliver poverty, misery, depression. I will deliver jobs, jobs, jobs.\\\"For the first time in a campaign upended by the coronavirus pandemic, it really felt like battleground Wisconsin, with both candidates in the state just hours apart from one another. Biden said the president had been unwilling to take on a virus that has killed nearly 230,000 Americans, noting Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, last weekend said, \\\"We are not going to control the pandemic.\\\" \\\"The thing that bothers me the most was the president who gave up,\\\" Biden said.He argued Trump had hurt the state's economy with trade wars, saying he had \\\"devastated the Wisconsin dairy industry\\\" and caused mass layoffs.\\\"Harley-Davidson slashed 800 manufacturing jobs, repurchased stock ... and then shifted some of its production overseas. So much for helping,\\\" Biden said, referring to the Milwaukee motorcycle company.\\\" But Trump argued it was Biden who had caused workers to suffer during his decades as a politician. \\\"At every turn, Biden betrayed American workers and twisted his knife into the back of Wisconsin workers,\\\" Trump said. \\\"You suffered as much as anybody.\\\" Trump criticized recent polls that show him trailing Biden in Wisconsin, saying he has held successful campaign rallies and declared: \\u201cIt\\u2019s called suppression polls. You know what it does? It suppresses the vote.\\u201dTrump thanked former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for his endorsement and said the Hall of Famer was \\\"tough as hell.\\\"Since mid-October, Trump has mounted a furious bid to reclaim Wisconsin's electoral votes, making stops in Janesville, Waukesha and West Salem, drawing large, enthusiastic crowds, similar to what happened four years ago when he came from behind in the polls to defeat Hillary Clinton.He'll return to Wisconsin Monday night with a rally at Kenosha Regional Airport.Biden, making his third trip to Wisconsin, last appeared in the state in September, visiting a foundry in Manitowoc. Democrats have vowed not to repeat the mistake Clinton made of not visiting the state during the 2016 general election. Biden made a reference to that promise as he gave a shout-out to Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. \\\"Tom remembers I came up here and campaigned for Hillary and for a whole lot of reasons, not all of which were her fault, ended up not taking it as seriously,\\\" Biden said. \\\"We thought it was different. Now I\\u2019ve been here a lot and by the way when I get elected, if I get elected, I\\u2019m coming back, Tom.\\\"The Milwaukee visit was Biden's third stop of the day, after drive-in rallies in Des Moines, Iowa, and St. Paul, Minnesota.Last week, Trump sought to hold a large rally at Mitchell Airport but was turned down by airport authorities. They said the event would have run counter to the city's 250-person limit on outdoor gatherings, which is in place because of the coronavirus pandemic, and would also have affected flights in and out of the facility.\\\"The Airport does not allow political rallies on the airfield, regardless of which candidate requests it,\\\" airport spokesman Harold Mester said in a statement that noted Biden's event was far smaller than the one Trump had planned.Biden's event adhered to the city's health restrictions, with about 50 people, including journalists, in attendance. A maximum of 100 people are able to gather for religious and political events and must be seated, according to the city Health Department. The visits came as polls show Biden with an advantage in Wisconsin. Biden held a 5-point lead in this week's Marquette University Law School Poll, while two other surveys showed the former vice president further ahead in the race.Early in-person absentee voting is also winding down across the state with some larger communities allowing voting until Sunday while others are ending sooner.Already, 1.74 million people have voted by mail or in-person, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, about 58% of the 2016 turnout.The two candidates have taken two very different approaches to campaigning in the middle of the pandemic. And they were in a state where cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been spiking.Trump has continued to hold large rallies across the country, appearing in front of thousands of mostly unmasked supporters.Biden has appeared at far smaller events, where social distancing and mask-wearing are mandatory.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Sitemap Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy ChoicesContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Buy and Sell Help Center Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Store Licensing & Reprints Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Promote Your EventSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook X eNewspaper ArchivesJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events\\u00a9 2024 www.jsonline.com.
